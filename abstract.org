Automatic Relevance Determination for Gaussian Processes with Functional Inputs

In the context of Gaussian process regression, it is common to treat functional
inputs as a vector. The parameter space becomes prohibitively complex as the
functional input definition increases, thus hindering automatic relevance
determination. Generalizing work for time-varying inputs, we introduce the
automatic dynamic relevance determination (ADRD) framework to enforce smoothness
on the predictive relevance profile over the index space with only a limited
number of parameters. Fully Bayesian estimation is carried out to identify
relevant regions of the functional input space and validation is performed to
benchmark against traditional vector-input model specifications. In a case study
for surrogate modeling, we find that ADRD outperforms models with input
dimension reduction via functional principal component analysis. Furthermore,
the predictive power is comparable to high-dimensional models, in terms of both
mean prediction and uncertainty, with 10 times fewer tuning parameters. Finally,
ADRD rules out erratic patterns associated with vector-input models.

Luis is a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at Iowa State University. His research
focuses on surrogate modeling, in particular the topic of automatic relevance
determination for Gaussian processes with functional inputs. He is also
co-author in environment and soil ecology papers. He had previously worked on
time series and spatial modeling, including published software. He was an intern
at Los Alamos National Laboratory and a Google Summer of Code student for the R
project for statistical computing on two occasions.
